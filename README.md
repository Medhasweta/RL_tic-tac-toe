# TIC-TAC-TOE
# Overview
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using reinforcement learning (RL) in Python. The RL agent learns to play Tic-Tac-Toe through repeated gameplay, refining its strategy over time. The program uses the Q-learning algorithm, a popular method in reinforcement learning, to determine the best moves based on the state of the game.

# Features
Reinforcement Learning Implementation: Utilizes the Q-learning algorithm for training the agent.
Flexible Training: Set the number of games for the agent to learn from.
Human Interaction: Option to play against the trained AI.
Dynamic Learning Rates: Epsilon and alpha values decay over time, adjusting the balance between exploration and exploitation.

# Usage
To run the game:
python tic_tac_toe_rl.py
